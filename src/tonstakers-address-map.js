/**
 * Tonstakers deployments, keyed by TON network id (-239 mainnet, -3 testnet).
 *
 * `pool` is the Tonstakers liquid-staking pool contract — stakes are messages
 * to it, and every on-chain read (`get_pool_full_data`) runs on it. `jetton`
 * is the tsTON jetton minter; unstakes are burns sent to the account's own
 * tsTON jetton wallet, resolved from the minter's `get_wallet_address`.
 * `partnerCode` is the referral attribution carried in the stake payload
 * (Tonstakers' partner program) — the official SDK's default ships here, a
 * partner overrides it through `config.partnerCode`.
 *
 * Mainnet verified live (2026-09-04): tonapi labels the pool `tonstake_pool`
 * (implementation liquidTF, verified), the minter reports symbol tsTON /
 * 9 decimals, and `get_pool_full_data`'s `jetton_minter` resolves to it.
 * Testnet ships only the pool address the SDK publishes; pass the rest via
 * `config.addresses` when you need it.
